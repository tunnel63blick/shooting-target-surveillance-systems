# shooting-target-surveillance-systems
how to and why this or that decision based on my very personal opinions


All starts with the need to watch at a shooting target. 

The classical approach is to use some kind of telescopic device like binoculars or spotting scopes.

There is nothing wrong with that but you also need a good spotting scope stand or tripod which needs space on the stand and 
is often a bit fragile. Another side effect is that you have to breake up how you are standing for shooting to watch your target. 
Good spooting scopes with high usable magnification, for higher distances, are expensive, heavy and need a more rigid tripod. 
Watching a target over long distances can be a challenge as big as shooting at it.

So, what can we do to make shooters life easyer?

It depends. 

It depends on environment, distances, your personal needs and how much money you can burn for that.

Like many others i started with an affordable spotting scope with 20 to 45 magnification. Not bad. Works for 25m and also for 50m even with .22lfr. But a bit uncomfortable to watch through so there was the idea to use a camera and a display. Bird spotter do that, why not. Looks easy.

And so i opened a can of worms...

Android Devices with OTG and USB-Camera

Very inconsistent!

There are USB camera devices which work on some android devices and do not on others up to breaking the whole device down. So the assumption is: it works ... maybe.

All of them work with Windows PCs so my assumption is that the android OTG stack is not very reliable, depending on chipset, whatever

Samsung A6  works with SV-USB4KCAM01H-CFV but not good with SV-USB8MP02G-SFV and my 1920x1080ELP
Samsung A52S works not with SV-USB4KCAM01H-CFV but good with SV-USB8MP02G-SFV and my 1920x1080ELP
Samsung Tab A9 works not with with SV-USB8MP02G-SFV, reboots, also not with my SV-USB4KCAM01H-CFV, not even recognized, but with my 1920x1080ELP
